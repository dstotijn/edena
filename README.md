# Edena

**Edena** is a toolkit for capturing out-of-band data via HTTP, DNS and SMTP. It
can be used to host a simple HTTP "request bin", but can also be used for
(long-term) out-of-band application security testing (OAST). The project aims to
offer a complete set of features, including an API as well as a web UI for
management.
